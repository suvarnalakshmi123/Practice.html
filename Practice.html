    <i><ul><li>A shepherd boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields
    near the forest. </li><br /><li>He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.
    One day while grazing the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is
    carrying away a lamb!".</li> <br  /> <li>Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for
    help but didn’t find any wolf. The boy laughed and replied, "It was just
    fun. There is no wolf here".</li> <br /><li>The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for
    many days. After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the
    herd of sheep, suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked
    one of the lambs.</li> <br /><li>The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf! The
    wolf is carrying a lamb away!" The farmers thought the boy was playing
    mischief again. So, no one paid attention to him and didn’t come to his
    help.</i></ul></li>
